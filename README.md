Before applying any matching techniques, preprocess the datasets using `preprocess_datasets.py`:

## Techniques Overview


### Traditional Techniques

- **File**: `traditional_techniques.py`
- **Description**: Contains other traditional techniques for data matching. This script includes various methods and approaches for comparing records and identifying matches based on predefined criteria.
- **Output**: Dumps matching records into a text file named string_similarity_results.txt. This file contains the records that have been identified as matches after applying the string similarity techniques and filtering out duplicates.

  
### Optimized Traditional Techniques

- **File**: `traditional_tech_optimized.py`
- **Description**: This technique improves upon traditional rule-based methods by incorporating optimization strategies such as blocking and similarity thresholds. Blocking reduces the number of comparisons by grouping records into blocks based on certain attributes, and similarity thresholds help in determining matches more accurately.
- **Output**: Dumps matching records into a text file named `matching_records.txt`. This file contains the records that have been identified as matches after applying the optimized techniques.


### Traditional Techniques (Rule-Based)

- **File**: `traditional_techniques_rule_based.py`
- **Description**: This technique uses predefined rules to match records between two datasets. It typically involves comparing specific fields (like names, emails, etc.) and applying logical conditions to determine if two records are a match.
- **Output**: Dumps matched pairs into a text file named `matches_rule_based.txt`. In this file, you will find pairs of indices from the two datasets that have been identified as matches based on the rule-based criteria.


### Traditional Techniques (R)

- **File**: `traditional_techniques_r.py`
- **Description**: Contains traditional techniques for data matching implemented in R. This script includes methods for comparing records based on various attributes and applying logical rules to determine matches.

### Modern Techniques (Neural Networks)

- **File**: `modern_techniques_neural_networks.py`
- **Description**: This technique uses neural networks to match records between datasets. Neural networks are trained on labeled data to learn complex patterns and relationships between different attributes, making them effective for data matching tasks.
- **Output**: This script does not dump content into a text file by default. It trains a neural network model and evaluates its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Modern Techniques (Random Forest)

- **File**: `modern_techniques_random_forest.py`
- **Description**: This technique uses a Random Forest classifier to match records. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
- **Output**: This script does not dump content into a text file by default. It trains a Random Forest model and evaluates its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
